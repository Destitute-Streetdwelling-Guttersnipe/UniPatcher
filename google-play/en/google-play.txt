Utility to apply patches to game ROM-files.

<b>Please read before you download:</b> This program will not help you hack native Android games, it was created for the old console games (Super Nintendo, Sega MegaDrive, Game Boy Advance, Sony PlayStation etc.).


<b>UniPatcher</b> allows you to apply patches to the game ROM-file. What is a <i>patch</i>? The patch is a file with the modified data of the game. For example, a game translated from Japanese to English. You download the patch containing the translation. It must be applied to the Japanese version to get the game in English.

<b>How to use?</b> Very simple:
&bull; Choose a patch

<b><u>Very important:</u> if the game and patch is compressed (ZIP, RAR, 7z or other), they first need to be unzipped (I recommend the freeware (gratis) program ZArchiver).</b>
