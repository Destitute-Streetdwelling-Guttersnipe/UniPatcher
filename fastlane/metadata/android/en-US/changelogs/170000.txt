- Replaced the built-in file manager with the standard Storage Access Framework. Work with files on SD card and cloud hosting (e.g. Google Drive). Applying patches requires more time and free disk space. File checksum view temporarily removed.
- Support for LZMA compression in XDelta3 patches
- Removed ability to add SMC header to SNES ROMs (over the years I have never needed this function)
- Support for Android 10 and 11
- No disappearing notifications
- Many small interface changes
